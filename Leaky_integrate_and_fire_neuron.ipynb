    "We have already seen Hodgkin-Huxley's model of spiking in the squid giant axon. This is a rather complex model. Researchers often simplify the spiking neuron as an [integrate and fire](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S3.html) (IF) neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercise 3 in the [Synapses](./Synapses.ipynb) notebook you may have noticed that when two spikes arrive at the synapse close together in time, their effects add up. When spikes arrive simultaneously at multiple synapses, their effect also add up similarly. When the EPSP goes above the threshold for spiking, the neuron generates a spike. To mimic this, we can have a neuron model which adds up its input, and fires an action potential whenever the voltage goes above threshold. A simple version of this abstraction was developed by [Warren McCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch) and [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts), called [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) or McCulloch-Pitts neuron, forms the foundation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).\n",
    "\n",
    "The integrate and fire model tries to to mimic the biophysics of the neuron in more detail. It implements this by adding the inputs to the present membrane voltage which keeps decaying with a time constant (RC circuit). When the voltage crosses the threshold, the neuron generates a spike and its voltage is reset to a small value. Also, neurons need some minimum time to recover after a spike, which is called refractory period. Once an IF neuron spikes, it cannot fire another spike within this time. There are many variations of the integrate and fire model, and in what we describe above, the decay represents leakage of the current through the RC circuit, and hence it is called Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) model. In moose this is implemented by the class `IntFire`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LIF model can be described mathematically as\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_{m} \\frac{dV_{m}(t)}{dt} = I(t) - \\frac{V_{m}(t)}{R_{m}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "or $\\frac{dV_{m}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{I(t)}{C_{m}} - \\frac{V_{m}(t)}{R_{m} C_{m}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "or $\\frac{dV_{m}(t)}{dt} = activation - \\frac{V_{m}(t)}{\\tau_{m}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $activation$ is $\\frac{I(t)}{C_{m}}$, a value proportional to the total input synaptic current, and $\\tau_{m} = R_{m} C_{m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the firing time is\n",
    "\n",
    "$t^{(f)}: V_{m}(t) = threshold$ \n",
    "\n",
    "if $t - t^{(f)}_{last}> t_{r}$ where $t_{r}$ is the refractory period and $t^{(f)}_{last}$ is the time of last firing.\n",
    "\n",
    "And right after the firing event, the voltage is reset to a fixed value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{\\delta \\to 0+} V_{m}(t^{(f)} + \\delta) = V_{reset}$\n",
