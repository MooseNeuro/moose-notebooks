It has many channels that allow charge-carrying ions to move between the cytoplasm and the external medium. The moving ions face resistance in their movement, which can be modeled as a resistor (Rm).

    "The `scipy` module in Python provides several functions for solving ODEs. The recommended method for this kind of problem is [`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html#scipy.integrate.solve_ivp). `ivp` stands for initial value problem, where we can set the initial values of the parameter(s) of our ODE, and then compute how they evolve with time (the independent variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function signature is: `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp(fun, t_span, y0, ...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `fun` must be a function with signature `fun(t, y)` where `y` is the dependent variable (in our case $V$) and `t` is the independent variable (time). This function must return the value of $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ at time $t$. $y0$ is the initial value of $y$, i.e., its value at time $t = t_{0}$ ($t_{0} = 0$ if we start our clock at that moment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we could translate the equation above to this function\n",

    "  at time t and current voltage v\"\"\"\n",
    "  return (i - v/R)/C\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, there is a problem. How would our function know the value of `i`, `R` and `C`?\n",
    "One possibility is to keep them as global constants in our script.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can set $R$ to $10 kS$ and $C$ to $0.1 \\mu F$ which will give a time constant of $\\tau = RC = 1 ms$. We can test this circuit by injecting $1 \\mu A$ current into it.\n",
