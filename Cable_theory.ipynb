    "Creating a voltage clamp is a bit tricky compared to a current clamp. A voltage clamp circuit checks the voltage at the electrode, and if it is below the command voltage (the desired value), then injects some current to raise it. If it is above, then injects some negative current to reduce it. In general the exact amount of current cannot be calculated analytically, so the system can overshoot in either direction, and then further (hopefully smaller) corrections need to be made. This is done via a special kind of control circuit called a [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller). If we set the parameters for the PID controller well, the voltage will oscillate but get damped pretty quickly. With bad parameters, it can continue to oscillate.\n",
