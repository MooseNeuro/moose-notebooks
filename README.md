# MOOSE-Notebooks

These notebooks present hands-on tutorials for topics in modeling in Neuroscience and Systems Biology. The contents are

1. [Resting membrane potential](Resting_membrane_potential.ipynb)
   Discussion of Nernst-Planck and Nernst equation and Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation
2. [Getting started with compartmental modelling in MOOSE](Getting_started_with_compartmental_modelling_in_MOOSE.ipynb)
   Shows how to create a passive neuronal compartment in MOOSE
3. [More complex current injection protocol](More_complex_current_injection_protocol.ipynb)
   Shows how to generate various patterns of (current) pulses for injecting into a compartment
4. [Multi-compartmental neuron model](Multi-compartmental_neuron_model.ipynb)
   Describes how you can connect several compartments to create a neuronal cable
5. [Cable theory](Cable_theory.ipynb)
   Derives the cable equation and then shows its approximation using a voltage clamped multicompartmental cable
