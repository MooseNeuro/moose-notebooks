    "Neurons communicate with one another as well as nearby cells of other kind, like glia, at multiple time scales. When we are looking at very short time scales, like milliseconds to seconds, this communication promarily happens via connections called synapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary types of such connections: electrical and chemical synapses. Electrical synapses are also called *gap junctions*. At these junction the cell membranes of two neurons fuse together via channels made of protein molecules called *connexin* (*innexin* in insects), creating continuity of their cytoplasm. Electrical changes in one neuron directly flow into the connected neighbour and evoke corresponding changes there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other type of synapses do not involve direct connection, and there is a small gap of about 20-40 nm between the terminals of two neurons. Synapses occur between two axons (axo-axonic), two dendrites (dendro-denritic), axon and soma (axo-somatic), dendrite and soma (dendro-somatic). But synapses between axon terminal of one neuron (presynaptic) and dendrites of another (postsynaptic) is the simplest to start with. These are called axo-dendritic synapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A presynaptic terminal stores special chemicals in little sack-like structures called vesicles. When the terminal is depolarized, for example due to an action potential, vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release its chemical (called neurotransmitter) into the synaptic cleft. The molecules of the neurotransmitter diffuses through the cleft and attaches to receptor molecules on cellmembrane on the postsynaptic terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The receptor molecule may be a channel itself, and get opened when the neurotransmitter molecule bonds with it (like key opening a lock). Then based on what ions the receptor channel allows to flow, and electrochemical gradients of those ions, current can flow into or out of the postsynaptic terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If positive ions flow in, they increase (depolarize) the membrane voltage of the postsynaptic terminal. In current clamp experiments the positive blip (depolarization) in the membrane voltage is called excitatory post synaptic potential (EPSP). There several mathematical models of the EPSP time-course that provide good approximations experimental results. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple one is called the $\\alpha$ synapse. Like Hodgkin-Huxley type channels, here also we model the condutance of the synptic channel as a function of time (unlike HH channels it does not depend on the voltage).\n",
    "\n",
    "$g(t) = g_{max}\\ \\frac{t}{\\tau}\\ e^{-t/\\tau}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $g(t)$ is the coductance at $t$ time after onset (when the channel is turned on). $g_{max}$ is the peak conductance of the synapse. This function is called the $\\alpha$ function and hence the name of the model. We can easily compute and plot this using nunmpy and matplotlib.\n"
